# Decentralised Marketplace Solidity Smart Contract

Welcome to the **Decentralised Marketplace** project repository! This decentralized solana-based project from RiseIn's Solidity Fundamentals Course leverages the Solidity blockchain programming language to design, implement, and test a decentralised Marketplace smart contract for the Ethereum network. Participants can verify sellers, add and update items, buy and sell items as well as receive payments.

## Overview

The **Decentralised Marketplace** Solidity smart contract provides an intuitive overview of the inner workings of a potential Marketplace dApp. You can think of it as a decentralised Facebook Marketplace on an Ethereum network. This project ensures transparency and trust in the local business or products in a controlled, yet free environment through the use of smart contracts. You'll find the presence of market authorities in the smart contract whose major purpose serves to verify a seller (any address submitted to become a seller on the platform) and remove a seller should the seller be in violation. The marketplace is to serve all items that can be listed for sale. Visitors / buyers can verify seller information linked with an item, view items from a specific seller,ake purchases. Sellers can also perform same functions as buyers.


## Features

- Owner and market authorities can add other market authorities
- Market authorities can verify Sellers
- Sellers can add & delete their listed items
- Sellers can view and withdraw sales balances from contract
- Buyers can retrieve seller and item information
- Contract returns excess value sent by buyres during purchase


## Smart Contracts

The Solidity smart contracts in this project facilitate the workings of the Decentralised Marketplace as described above.
